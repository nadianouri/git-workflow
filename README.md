# git-workflow

- git clone 
- create new branch from main branch
- publish branch to remote (github repos)
- updating `homepage` branch
- create pull request
- review pull request on github: https://github.com/nadianouri/git-workflow/pull/1 
- merge pull request. 
- pull changes to local `main` branch (git pull). 
- each time I add new changes to `homepage` branch, I have to create new Pull Request.
- select `main` branch and git pull 
- switch to `contactus` branch and git pull 
- `git pull from`, select `origin` and select branch `main`.
- git push `contactus` branch to remote ( in order to syncronise local with remote).
